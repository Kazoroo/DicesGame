# DicesGame
This is a mobile game on Android which is inspired by the mini-game from a PC game called Kingdome Come: Deliverance.
It consists of rolling 6 dice, and choosing the ones, that will give you the most points.
When on the board there aren't any pair of dices that will give any points, then it is skucha, which ends the your round.
The player who gets 4000 points wins.

Jetpack Compose and Kotlin are used. Work in progress
